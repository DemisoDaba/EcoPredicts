# EcoPredicts â€“ Urban Climate Risk Prediction Platform

## Description
EcoPredict is a **data-driven platform** that provides predictive insights on **urban environmental risks** such as floods, heatwaves, and air pollution. Using **satellite imagery, AI/ML models, and optionally IoT sensors**, the platform helps **cities, local governments, and communities** make proactive, data-driven decisions to improve **safety, resilience, and quality of life**.

## Key Features
- **Predictive modeling** of urban climate risks using AI/ML  
- **Integration of satellite data** for global coverage  
- **Optional IoT sensor data** for hyper-local accuracy  
- **Interactive visualization dashboard** for decision-makers  

## Purpose
The project is **open-source** to encourage **collaboration, transparency, and rapid development** of climate resilience tools. Contributors can help **improve models, add features, and expand the platform** to new regions.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DemisoDaba/EcoPredicts.git

2. **Install required Python libraries**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run example datasets** to explore predictive outputs
